Work Plan:
---------
* get drawing working with naive scan of pixels.
* get video invisible and canvas directly displaying what it has drawn.
* get initial login color capture, so that the user can choose what color to use.
* optimize drawing with experimenting with different BFS searches originating from last start search point.
* make it look pretty with some css
